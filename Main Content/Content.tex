\section{Introduction}

% Explain concept of simulation based interference, when and why it is used, and in which context we will use it (like gravitational waves)

\section{Normalizing flows}

% Go into more detail, explain the general math behind normalizing flows

\section{Gravitational waves}

% Explain the theory behind the approximant used to simulate the gravitational waves

% The approximant
% IMRPhenomXPHM  full inspiral-merger-ringdown + higher modes + spin precession | Medium | Highly accurate, standard in recent analyses
% SEOBNRv4PHM effective-one-body + precession | Slow | More accurate, slower than Phenom
% NRSur7dq4 Numerical relativity surrogate | fast | based on full GR simulations 
% TaylorF2 Post-Newtonian, inspiral only | fast | simple and educational

\section{result}

% Present results for different settings 

\section{discussion}

% Explain what problems we ran into
