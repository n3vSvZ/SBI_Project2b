\section*{What we did in week 1}

% What the general goal of our group was to achieve this week
\paragraph{General:}
Our goal was to familiarize ourselves with the theoretical background of our topic by reading relevant papers and to complete the first milestone--using SBI in a linear regression problem.
% What we did individually, we dont have to include alot of detail
\paragraph{David Littel:}

\paragraph{Sokratis Parmagkos:}
Toyed with the sbi library on a linear regression problem, and reviewed some theory from the suggested sources.

\paragraph{Katerina Theodoridou:}
Focused on studying the research papers for SBI and NPE that were provided. Additionally, ran an example implementation of the linear regression problem using the sbi library.

\paragraph{Sven van Zijl:}

\section*{What we will do in week 2}
We should study the theory more deeply to fill in the gaps in our understanding, while clarifying any questions from week 1 during our meetings with the mentors. Furthermore, complete the second milestone--comparing performance across various dimensions and selecting the simulator that will be our main focus in this project.
